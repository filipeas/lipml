# Library for Image Processing and Machine Learning (LIPML)

This Library had build for study during image processing and image analysis course in UNICAMP.

## To Do
- Implement some loss functions:
	- mae
	- mse
    - r2
    - rss
    - tss
	- cross entropy
	- focal loss
- Implement algorithms for statistic learning:
	- regressao linear
	- regressao logistica
    - Cp, AIC, BIC, Adjusted r2
	- knn
	- random forest
	- rede neural
	- cnn
	- rnn
	- lstm
	- transformer

## How to compile c++
- First, make shure you have c++ compile in your machine.
- Execute ``` chmod +x build.sh ``` on terminal. After, execute ``` ./build.sh ```.
- Opcionally, you can execute ``` mkdir build ``` and ``` cd build ```. After, execute ``` cmake .. ``` and ``` make ```.

## How to execute
- After compile, into folder **build** have a file **lipml**. Execute ``` ./lipml ```;

## Functions
- [IFT Algorithm](https://github.com/filipeas/lipml/tree/master/pseudocodes.md?tab=readme-ov-file#ift)
- Dynamic adjacency relation
- Some Data Structures:
    - linked list
    - circular list
    - bucket list
