# Library for Image Processing and Machine Learning (LIPML)

This Library had build for study during image processing and image analysis course in UNICAMP.

This project implement IFT algorithm (Image Foresting Transform) for make transformations in images. Below has a list with some manipulations into image using IFT.

[The paper of IFT is here.](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=343cb0ace2e88a237eb76db382c228bfcbaa053e)

## Dependences
- None

## How to compile c++
- First, make shure you have c++ compile in your machine.
- Execute ``` make ``` on terminal.
